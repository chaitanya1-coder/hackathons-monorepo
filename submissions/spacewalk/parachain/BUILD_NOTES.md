# Build Notes for Spacewalk Parachain

## Current Build Status

The parachain runtime and collator node structure is complete, but there are compilation errors that need to be resolved.

## Known Issues

1. **Dependency Names**: Some Cumulus/Polkadot SDK package names have been corrected:
   - `polkadot-parachain` → `polkadot-parachain-primitives`
   - `xcm` → `staging-xcm` (with package alias)
   - `xcm-executor` → `staging-xcm-executor` (with package alias)
   - `xcm-builder` → `staging-xcm-builder` (with package alias)

2. **Runtime Compilation Errors**:
   - `RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS` - Generated by `impl_runtime_apis!` macro, but used before it's defined
   - `Aura` and `Grandpa` types - Generated by `impl_opaque_keys!` macro
   - Cumulus pallet Config traits - May have changed in v1.6.0
   - XCM configuration - Needs proper implementation

3. **Node Dependencies**: Some Cumulus client packages don't exist or have different names

## Next Steps

1. Fix `RUNTIME_API_VERSIONS` by using a placeholder or reordering code
2. Fix `impl_opaque_keys!` to use correct type references
3. Update Cumulus pallet Config implementations for v1.6.0
4. Complete XCM executor configuration
5. Remove or fix non-existent node dependencies

## Recommended Approach

For now, the structure is in place. The compilation errors are expected for a first attempt at creating a parachain runtime. Consider:

1. Using the Polkadot SDK parachain template as a reference
2. Gradually porting the Spacewalk pallets
3. Testing each component as it's fixed

The foundation is solid - these are implementation details that can be resolved during the build/test phase.
